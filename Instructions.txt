The only this that kind of works right now is the first option "Play Audio".
The program stil doesnt load files from the user its only working by loading files manually through code.
Playing an individual song works with seeking with the slider, volume, playback speed.
If you press "open file explorer" it will load 3 different audios but switching between them breaks the slider for scrubbing through. You can still switch songs and they will still play.

A lot of the stuff is temporary but i want to get the core audio player screen working before i finish adding other things.
